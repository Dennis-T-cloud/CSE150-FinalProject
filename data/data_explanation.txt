For hpi_po_summary_cleaned, it is the same as the raw file with the following changes:
    - Starting at 1st quarter 1992 instead of 1991 (explanation below)
    - Column names changed for brevity
    - Removed the Region column since it is unecessary (The Region is always USA)

hpi_po_summary_condensed is similar, but all % change columns are dropped.

For index_observations, each entry is the Purchase-Only Index for 
that quarter. It is ordered sequentially, starting from the 1st quarter
of 1992 and ending on the 2nd quarter of 2025.

The same goes for adjusted_index_observations, except each entry is 
the Seasonally-Adjusted Purchase-Only Index. 

NOTE: Although the dataset starts at the 1st quarter of 1991, certain values 
are missing, so I opted to remove them (notably all the % change entries).
This is why entries start at the 1st quarter of 1992 instead.
These entries aren't too entirely important to the project I don't think, so 
let me know if you want me to include it again.
